\section{Summary of Report Achievements}
In Chapter~\ref{cha:data-classification}, we were able to create a model to classify tweets into
relevant and non relevant groups. We learnt that accuracy is not a good measure for a classifier's
performance. As a result we decided to use the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
Curve(AUC) as an evaluation metric. We also used k-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance
of our classifier on an unseen dataset. The average AUC of our
initial(\Sectionref{sec:training-initial-classifier}) and best
model(\Sectionref{sec:exhaustive-grid-search}) were 0.74 and 0.85, respectively. This means we
achieved a 13.8\% increase in AUC.

In other to create our initial training set, we used a web application which displayed a number of
tweets and options to classify them into relevant and irrelevant groups( \Figref{fig:labeller}). The
application was created for this project but can be used in other similar projects. The only
requirement is that tweets are stored in a MongoDB database. It can also be extended easily to
support extra features if required.

In Chapter~\ref{cha:topic-modelling}, we created two topic models, one with 30 topics and the other
with 40 topics. We empirically analysed and evaluated some of the topics generated by the 30 topics
model. We discovered that the topic model was able to correctly place the right tweets under the
right topics. We also learnt that LDA can sometimes merge two or three topics into one(
\Sectionref{sec:topic-9}, \Sectionref{sec:topic-13}, \Sectionref{sec:topic-27}).

Rather than re-evaluating the topics generated by the 40 topics model, we compared them to that
generated by the 30 topics model. This is in a effort to find out if there will be overlapping
topics considering the same dataset was used. Fortunately, we were able to find a few overlapping
topics(\Tableref{tab:similar-topics}).
