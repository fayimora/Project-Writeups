Every organisation out there today is constantly looking for ways to improve customer satisfaction.
\textit{Talk a little bit about 1 or two companies and how they do it (3 sentences\ldots ish)}

Social platforms like Facebook and Twitter generate an enormous amount of data on a daily basis.
People sometimes use these platforms as an avenue to express their thoughts about products they use.
They have discussions with each other about these products and make comparisons.

In this study, we will be making use of Apple Incorporated as a case study. We start by mining Apple
related data from Twitter and then we proceed to filtering this data into what is relevant and what
isn't. Once we have our relevant data, we will use a mixture of Machine Learning and Natural
Language Processing techniques to find common topics in the data. Furthermore, we will analyze the
sentiments of the data and investigate how it correlates with the topics. Lastly, we will evaluate
the techniques applied to determine which ones work best and why.
