\chapter{Topic Modelling}
\label{cha:topic_modelling}
In this chapter, we will try to find themes/topics that exist in our dataset. Our input dataset will
be a set of relevant tweets as determined by the classifier in the previous chapter. We will use
Latent Dirichlet Allocation as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bg_lda} on page \pageref{sec:bg_lda}.
