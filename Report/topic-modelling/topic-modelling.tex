\chapter{Topic Modelling}
\label{cha:topic_modelling}
In this chapter, we will try to find themes/topics that exist in our dataset. Our input dataset will
be a set of relevant tweets as determined by the classifier in the previous chapter. We will use
Latent Dirichlet Allocation as discussed in \Sectionref{sec:bg_lda} on page \pageref{sec:bg_lda}.

Tables~\ref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} and~\ref{tab:bigrams_lda} on pages
\pageref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} and \pageref{tab:bigrams_lda} each show a list of 20 topics and
their respective topic-words distribution. Each row comprises of a list of tokens(n-grams) that try
to explain a topic and they are ordered by their level of influence. While it is helpful to have our
tokens ordered by level of influence, the actual influence weights are excluded from the table
because we will not be paying too much attention to them during our analysis. We take a topic's
token associations and analyse them as if they had equal weights and use the weights to handle any
topic dilemmas.

\section{Analysing per-topic word distribution}
\label{sec:analysing_topic_word_distribution}
We will be analysing two separate models one of which will be using a mixture of unigrams and
bigrams as tokens while the other will make use of bigrams as tokens. This was inspired by our
experiments in \Sectionref{sec:training_classifier}. Our classifier showed better performance using
a mixture of unigrams and bigrams as well as bigrams alone. We will analyse a few topics for each
model and have a look at some of the tweets that fall under those topics.

  \caption{list of 20 word-topic distributions with unigrams and bigrams}
  \label{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda}
\end{table}

The topic-word distributions in \Tableref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} are a combination of unigrams
and bigrams. We will analyse Topics 0, 2, 4, 11 and 13.


\subsubsection{Topic 0}
\label{sec:topic_0}
\textit{bbm, android bbm, features bbm, perfect features, android, future, surveillance, happy, lt,
having}
At first glance, we could say this topic has a lot to do with \textit{android}, \textit{bbm}, and
\textit{features}. At the time of data gathering, there was a lot of chatter on social media about
the blackberry messenger coming to the android platform. To be certain of this, let's take a look at
some of the tweets that fall into this category.

\subsubsection{Topic 2}
\label{sec:topic_2}
\textit{win, enter, 100, today, halloween use, mini, free, halloween, video, want}

\subsubsection{Topic 4}
\label{sec:topic_4}
\textit{release, official release, air, got, charger, usa, life, just, fuck, work}

\subsubsection{Topic 11}
\label{sec:topic_11}
\textit{sales, tech, air, thing, news, people, tell, air sales, remains unknown, mini remains}

\subsubsection{Topic 13}
\label{sec:topic_13}
\textit{ll, like, chocolate, white, caramel, girls, dark, double, raspberry, mocha}
