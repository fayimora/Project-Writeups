\chapter{Topic Modelling}
\label{cha:topic_modelling}
In this chapter, we will try to find themes/topics that exist in our dataset. Our input dataset will
be a set of relevant tweets as determined by the classifier in the previous chapter. We will use
Latent Dirichlet Allocation as discussed in \Sectionref{sec:bg_lda} on page \pageref{sec:bg_lda}.

Tables~\ref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} and~\ref{tab:bigrams_lda} on pages
\pageref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} and \pageref{tab:bigrams_lda} each show a list of 20 topics and
their respective topic-words distribution. Each row comprises of a list of tokens(n-grams) that try
to explain a topic and they are ordered by their level of influence. While it is helpful to have our
tokens ordered by level of influence, the actual influence weights are excluded from the table
because we will not be paying too much attention to them during our analysis. We take a topic's
token associations and analyse them as if they had equal weights and use the weights to handle any
topic dilemmas.

\section{Analysing per-topic word distribution}
\label{sec:analysing_topic_word_distribution}
We will be analysing two separate models one of which will be using a mixture of unigrams and
bigrams as tokens while the other will make use of bigrams as tokens. This was inspired by our
experiments in \Sectionref{sec:training_classifier}. Our classifier showed better performance using
a mixture of unigrams and bigrams as well as bigrams alone. We will analyse a few topics for each
model and have a look at some of the tweets that fall under those topics.

\subsection{Using Unigrams and Bigrams}
\label{sec:unigrams_bigrams_lda}
The topic-word distributions in \Tableref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} are a combination of unigrams
and bigrams.

\begin{table}

\subsubsection{Topic 6}
\label{sec:topic_6}
\textit{ios, lets, bbm ios, ios lets, lets apps, features, game, tech, missed} \\\\
The most common theme in the above distribution is ``ios'' and ``lets''. ``bbm'' also seems to have
a considerate amount of relevancy as it is the third most relevant token. The other tokens seem
random but we should be able to explain them better after taking a look at some of the tweets with a
fair proportion of this topic.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & 81\%       & Fantastical 2 for iPhone gets bold iOS 7 redesign, many new features \#tech \\ \midrule
    2  & 75\%       & Limbo for iOS is now even cheaper at \$0.99 \\ \midrule
    3  & 80\%       & Don't miss out on loads of great iOS game sales from\ldots \\ \midrule
    4  & 70\%       & What new features does Apple's iOS 7 boast? \\ \midrule
    5  & 63\%       & get the BBM on iPhone iOS, lets get the apps here now \\ \midrule
    6  & 89\%       & time guessing is hard! test yourself on ur iPhone it's \#cool tweet your
    results from the app \#game \#ios \#app \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Tweets classified under topic 6}
  \label{tab:tweets_under_6}
\end{table}

The tweets in \Tableref{tab:tweets_under_6} all seem to have at least 63\% of topic 6. While they
might look like carefully selected tweets, they were actually chosen at random. Our dataset contains
a large fraction of the third, fourth and fifth tweet. Approximately 90\% of them are retweets which
explains why our topic model extracted ``ios lets'', ``lets apps'', ``game'' and ``tech'' as
relevant tokens. The sixth tweet arguably does not really have anything to do with ``iOS'' but
because it has been tagged with three words that our topic model finds salient, it gets tagged as
having 89\% proportion of topic 6.



\subsubsection{Topic 7}
\label{sec:topic_7}
\textit{google, backed, google samsung, mobile, nortel, patents, microsoft backed, rockstar, backed
rockstar, uses } \\\\

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & 86\%       & Apple files patent for slim solar-powered technology via GigaOM \\ \midrule
    2  & 78\%       & Google, Samsung, and others sued over search patents by Apple-backed Nortel group \\ \midrule
    3  & 83\%       & Apple, Microsoft-backed Rockstar uses Nortel patents to sue Google, Samsung and others \\ \midrule
    4  & 78\%       & Google Fiber comes to iPhone, iPod touch with DVR functions \\ \midrule
    5  & 80\%       & Google Replacing Android ID With Advertising ID Similar To Apple's IDFA \\ \midrule
    6  & 68\%       & Nexus 4 will get the updated "in the coming weeks". If Apple can offer to
    update the (almost) entire install base on day 1, why not Google? \\ \bottomrule

  \end{tabular}

  \label{tab:tweets_under_9}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Topic 12}
\label{sec:topic_12}
\textit{day, battery, good, shit, display, thanks, battery life, omg, seriously, ios7}\\\\
The most salient token we have is ``day'' which does not mean much to us. Our token-distribution
also seems to have a number of adverbs, adjectives and slang like ``good'', ``seriously'' and
``omg''. These all seem to represent sentiments towards a certain topic. Ignoring them, we are left
with ``thanks'', ``battery'' and ``battery life''. At this point, we could postulate that most of
the tweets in this category will have a ``battery'' theme. To confirm this, we take a look at some
of the tweets with a fair proportion of the topic.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & 81\%       & iPhone battery just went from 23\% to 3\% in the space of five minutes. Thanks again, iOS7. \\ \midrule
    2  & 76\%       & iPhone battery is so crap \\ \midrule
    3  & 80\%       & iPhone battery dropping in 5\% increments. Can't be a good sign. \\ \midrule
    4  & 64\%       & Considering the amount of times I have to plug my IPhone in to charge a day it might as well be a fucking landline \\ \midrule
    5  & 50\%       & FORGOT MY IPHONE CHARGER oh shit man. My poor battery :( \\ \midrule
    6  & 66\%       & Apple was considering making an iPod for kids but apparently, the name iTouch Kids didn't sit too well. \\ \midrule
    7  & 50\%       & so your apple store doesn't get stock on release day? \\ \midrule
    8  & 50\%       & can I have an iphone with bbm and the battery life of a nokia please \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Tweets classified under topic 12}
  \label{tab:tweets_under_12}
\end{table}

All tweets(except the 7th) in \Tableref{tab:tweets_under_12} all refer to the iPhone battery life. A
very large number of tweets that have a good proportion of this topic take in some way, the shape of
tweets 1--4 in our table and fortunately, our topic model is able to find the relationship between
these tweets.

The seventh tweet looks out of place as it has nothing to do with battery life but
going back to our topic-token distribution, the most salient token as described by the model is
``day''. Luckily, our dataset also contains a large number of that tweet. This is because that
articular tweets was retweeted a lot of times.


\subsubsection{Topic 13}
\label{sec:topic_13}
\textit{android, use, blackberry, update, web, 11, issues, devices, hd, fix issues}\\\\
At first glance, the main themes that stand out in the above distribution are ``android'',
``blackberry'' and ``issues''.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & 51\%       & Wow hello typos\ldots cracked iphone screen problems \\ \midrule
    2  & 50\%       & Check out WhatsApp Messenger for BlackBerry, Android, iPhone, Nokia and Windows Phone. Download it today from\ldots \\ \midrule
    3  & 50\%       & Pandora finally comes to Chromecast via Android and iPhone apps \\ \midrule
    4  & 80\%       & I just connected with friends on \#BBM\@. Invite your BlackBerry, Android and iPhone friends at\ldots \\ \midrule
    5  & 80\%       & Develop iPhone, Ipad and Android Apps creatively with Mawaqaa. \\ \midrule
    6  & 75\%       & Was curious if that was the culprit. I have had tons of issues since upgrading my Apple devices to latest \\ \midrule
    7  & 57\%       & Apple testing Mail update for OS X Mavericks to fix several issues \\ \midrule
    8  & 78\%       & Manufacturing issue causing battery problems in some iPhone 5s devices \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Tweets classified under topic 13}
  \label{tab:tweets_under_13}
\end{table}

Tweet 2--5 in \Tableref{tab:tweets_under_13} all have either an android or blackberry theme in them
which is expected. Tweet 1, 6, 7 and 8 all have either an ``issues'' or ``device'' theme in them.
These should arguably be two different topics but our model has merged them.


\subsubsection{Topic 14}
\label{sec:topic_14}
\textit{official, 5s, 5c, life, models, cracked, color, worries, nexus, highlighters}\\\\

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & \%       & \\ \midrule
    2  & \%       & \\ \midrule
    3  & \%       & \\ \midrule

\end{table}



\subsubsection{Topic 27}
\label{sec:topic_27}
\textit{bbm, bbm android, official release, android official, android bbm, perfect features,
features bbm, want, buy, need} \\\\
At first glance, we could say this topic has a lot to do with \textit{android}, \textit{bbm}, and
\textit{features}. The last three tokens also seem out of place. At the time of data gathering,
there was a lot of chatter on social media about the BlackBerry Messenger(BBM) application coming to
the iOS and android platform. To be certain of this, let's take a look at some of the tweets that
have a fair proportion of this topic.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & 56\%       & More perfect features, BBM android, BBM iPhone \\ \midrule
    2  & 50\%       & BBM on android and iPhone, official release - get it here \\ \midrule
    3  & 50\%       & BBM Now on Android and iPhone. \\ \midrule
    4  & 72\%       & Just got bbm chat for the iPhone, feel free to add me if you want :) \\ \midrule
    5  & 60\%       & Apple should create the option of removing yourself from a group chat \\ \midrule
    6  & 68\%       & Anyone want to buy a black 64GB ipad 2 from me in excellent condition? \\ \midrule
    7  & 25\%       & someone buy me an iphone ugh \\ \midrule
    8  & 76\%       & I need a iphone 5 asap \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Tweets classified under topic 27}
  \label{tab:tweets_under_27}
\end{table}

\Tableref{tab:tweets_under_27} is a list of tweets that fall under topic 27. We can see that the
first four tweets have a lot to do with the new BBM for iOS and Android. The fifth tweet is a little
tricky as it says nothing about BBM\@. However, it does in fact talk about a chat application which is
what BBM is. While the user might not have been referring to BBM in particular, our model was able
to pickup on the relationship between both subjects.

The last three tweets in our table explain the last three tokens in out topic-word distribution for
topic 27. This means that topic 27 is actually a combination of two different topics.



\subsubsection{Topic 28}
\label{sec:topic_28}
\textit{mini, win, chance, come, chance win, case mini, kickstand, kickstand case, mini models,
models red}\\\\

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & 75\%       & Win an \$800 Mac Mini for FREE from MacTrast the perfect addition to any home or office! \\ \midrule
