\chapter{Topic Modelling}
\label{cha:topic_modelling}
In this chapter, we will try to find themes/topics that exist in our dataset. Our input dataset will
be a set of relevant tweets as determined by the classifier in the previous chapter. We will use
Latent Dirichlet Allocation as discussed in \Sectionref{sec:bg_lda} on page \pageref{sec:bg_lda}.

Tables~\ref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} and~\ref{tab:bigrams_lda} on pages
\pageref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} and \pageref{tab:bigrams_lda} each show a list of 20 topics and
their respective topic-words distribution. Each row comprises of a list of tokens(n-grams) that try
to explain a topic and they are ordered by their level of influence. While it is helpful to have our
tokens ordered by level of influence, the actual influence weights are excluded from the table
because we will not be paying too much attention to them during our analysis. We take a topic's
token associations and analyse them as if they had equal weights and use the weights to handle any
topic dilemmas.

\section{Analysing per-topic word distribution}
\label{sec:analysing_topic_word_distribution}
We will be analysing two separate models one of which will be using a mixture of unigrams and
bigrams as tokens while the other will make use of bigrams as tokens. This was inspired by our
experiments in \Sectionref{sec:training_classifier}. Our classifier showed better performance using
a mixture of unigrams and bigrams as well as bigrams alone. We will analyse a few topics for each
model and have a look at some of the tweets that fall under those topics.

\subsection{Using Unigrams and Bigrams}

\end{table}

The topic-word distributions in \Tableref{tab:unigrams_bigrams_lda} are a combination of unigrams
and bigrams.


\subsubsection{Topic 27}
\label{sec:topic_27}
\textit{bbm, bbm android, official release, android official, android bbm, perfect features, features bbm,
want, buy, need} \\\\
At first glance, we could say this topic has a lot to do with \textit{android}, \textit{bbm}, and
\textit{features}. The last three tokens also seem out of place. At the time of data gathering,
there was a lot of chatter on social media about the BlackBerry Messenger(BBM) coming to the iOS and
android platform. To be certain of this, let's take a look at some of the tweets that fall into this
category.\\

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c c p{13cm}} \toprule
    No & Proportion & Tweet \\ \midrule
    1  & 56\%       & More perfect features, BBM android, BBM iPhone \\ \midrule
    2  & 50\%       & BBM on android and iPhone, official release - get it here \\ \midrule
    3  & 50\%       & BBM Now on Android and iPhone. \\ \midrule
    4  & 72\%       & Just got bbm chat for the iPhone, feel free to add me if you want :) \\ \midrule
    5  & 60\%       & Apple should create the option of removing yourself from a group chat \\ \midrule
    6  & 68\%       & Anyone want to buy a black 64GB ipad 2 from me in excellent condition? \\ \midrule
    7  & 25\%       & someone buy me an iphone ugh \\ \midrule
    8  & 76\%       & I need a iphone 5 asap \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Tweets classified under topic 27}
  \label{tab:tweets_under_27}
\end{table}

\Tableref{tab:tweets_under_27} is a list of tweets that fall under topic 27. We can see that the
first four tweets have a lot to do with the new BBM for iOS and Android. The fifth tweet is a little
tricky as it says nothing about BBM\@. However, it does in fact talk about a chat application which is
what BBM is. While the user might not have been referring to BBM in particular, our model was able
to pickup on the relationship between both subjects.

The last three tweets in out table explain the last three tokens in out topic-word distribution for
topic 27.
