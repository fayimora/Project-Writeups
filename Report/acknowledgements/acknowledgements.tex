\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

\begin{acknowledgements}
A lot of people have contributed in different ways to the success of this project but firstly, I
would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Matthew Purver who was very helpful throughout the project.

I would also like to thank the authors of all the tools used in this project. Without those
tools, this project could not have been completed within the time frame.

Thanks to all the volunteers who helped with the evaluations and also those who proof read the report.
Names are too numerous to mention so I say thank you all.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their continual support to my studies.
